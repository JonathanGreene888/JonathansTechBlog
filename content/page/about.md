## School

I Attended Lambda School a 9 month long software engineering academy that focuses on full stack development use the MERN (Mongo, React, Express, Node) stack as well as teachning datastructures and alogrithms. There I learned full stack responsive web development as well as how to learn things quickly and be productive to any team very quickly.
